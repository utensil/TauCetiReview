# Security model

This records the threat model, design decisions, and accepted residual risks for the Tau Ceti
automated review system. It came out of a nine-angle adversarial audit (2026-06) and the
hardening that followed (issues #7–#15, #22).

## What runs

Production review generation currently runs from a trusted operator-run worker plus ad hoc trusted
contributors' command lines. The reusable CI workflow (`.github/workflows/review.yml`) can perform
the same metered-API review after a green build or an authorized `/review`, but Tau Ceti currently
disables that generation path to conserve budget. Either path runs each rubric through a read-only
reviewer CLI and posts a scoreboard plus per-rubric findings. The independent auto-merge workflows
consume the posted scoreboard.

## Trust boundary

The PR diff, description, comments, and file contents are **attacker-controlled**. Every
reviewer is treated as potentially prompt-injected. The design does not try to prevent
injection (it can't, see R1); instead it ensures an injected reviewer **has nothing worth
stealing and no power to merge on its own**.

## The leak chain

A secret reaches a public artifact (the public `reviews` branch or a PR comment) only if all
four links hold:

1. **the secret is present in the job** — provider keys, the GitHub App token;
2. **the reviewer can reach it** — via its environment or the filesystem;
3. **the attacker induces it into the model's output** — prompt injection in the diff;
4. **we persist/publish that output** — committed to the public branch, posted as a comment.

We deliberately keep transcripts public with **no redaction gate** (link 4 is open by choice),
so safety rests entirely on breaking links 1–2: removing the reviewer's *access* to any secret.

## Mitigations (mapped to audit findings)

- **I1** — never evaluate PR-controlled Lake configuration in the privileged job; Mathlib source
  is cloned at the rev pinned in the *base* manifest. Dependency bumps may change only the manifest
  and toolchain pins, which a trusted validator reads as data and checks for forward movement before
  they are overlaid inside the secretless landrun sandbox. Lakefiles never enter the automated merge
  scope. Closes the pre-auth RCE.
- **I2** — reviewers run in a clean workspace (PR source without `.git`, roadmap, Mathlib,
  diff) with a minimal **per-provider** env: only that provider's key, never the other key and
  never a GitHub token. Keys are staged to files, read into memory, and unlinked before any
  reviewer runs. `persist-credentials: false` on every checkout. codex uses
  `shell_environment_policy.inherit=none`.
- **I3** — the App token is split into two narrowly-scoped tokens (TauCeti `pull-requests:write`
  to comment; TauCetiReview `contents:write` to persist), minted only *after* reviewers finish.
- **I4** — `/review` requires an exact command line (not a substring); per-PR daily round cap.
- **I5** — reserve-before-spend: skip a rubric if spend-so-far plus a per-call ceiling would
  breach the daily budget; count every attempt; persist spend incrementally.
- **I6** — the verdict is parsed only from after a one-time random marker the runner injects per
  review. Attacker content (including a forged `{"verdict":"approve"}`) sits before the marker
  and is ignored; parsing fails closed on a missing marker, bad JSON, or an out-of-set verdict.
- **I7** — an approval is bound to the `head_sha` + a fingerprint of the rubric text. A new
  commit or a rubric edit re-runs all rubrics instead of carrying forward stale approvals.
- **I8** — reviewers are told to assume an adversarial, possibly same-model author and to verify
  substance rather than defer to fluent output (we accept self-declared provenance and treat any
  mismatch as the reviewer's problem to catch — no provider-exclusion machinery).

## Auto-merge gate (I9)

Merging is performed by the `tauceti-review-bot` GitHub App, which is a **review-bypass actor**
on `main` (no machine user account is used; a GitHub App cannot be a CODEOWNER). A PR is merged
only when **all** of:

- the newest marked scoreboard comment names the current commit and says every rubric approves;
- TauCeti CI's trusted `scope` status is green on the current commit, and every changed path is
  under `TauCeti/` or an explicitly allowed root pin; lakefiles are never allowed;
- any PR touching a Lake pin has a green trusted `bump-guard`;
- CI's `build` check is green (status checks are **not** bypassed, only the review requirement).

In Tau Ceti production, review generation and auto-merge are independent. The `Review` workflow's
enabled state plus the `CI_REVIEW_ENABLED` repository variable on `TauCetiProject/TauCeti` control
metered review generation; disabling it does not pause scoreboard-driven merging. The reusable
review workflow's `enable_automerge` input is not the production merge path. To pause automated
merging, disable both the `Auto-merge` and `Merge sweep` workflows in `TauCetiProject/TauCeti`; both
must be re-enabled to resume normal operation.

## Residual risks (knowingly accepted)

- **R1 — prompt injection is not eliminable.** No wording makes an LLM immune. Contained by
  zero-privilege reviewers and no unilateral merge authority; treat every reviewer as injected.
- **R2 — two-provider independence ceiling.** With only claude + codex, excluding the author
  would leave a single model deciding everything, so the gate is one model with no cross-check.
  Removing this needs a third provider or a human second-signal.
- **R3 — fork auto-review depends on the sandbox staying airtight.** GitHub-hosted runners are
  not a hard boundary against a determined attacker with network egress; we mitigate to "no
  secret is reachable to exfiltrate," which is the achievable bar.
- **R7 — scoreboard trust is social.** The merge workflows deliberately apply no
  author-association gate to scoreboard comments. A PR author without repository write access can
  post their own all-green board; because the newest board by `updated_at` wins, posting a new board
  or editing an old one also supersedes a genuine changes-requested board. This can satisfy the
  review signal, although it cannot bypass the trusted `build` (which carries the axiom audit),
  `scope`, path-policy, or `bump-guard` checks. Restricting who may supply the review signal would be
  a separate policy change.
- **R6 — a reviewer can read its *own* provider key** via `/proc/self/environ` (the CLI needs
  it to function). Blast radius is one key, only on model compliance with injection. Tracked in
  issue #22; the real fix is uid-separation or a local auth proxy.
- **Admin bypass.** `enforce_admins` is off (human break-glass); the bot's token has no admin
  and cannot bypass status checks.

## CI build sandbox (TauCeti)

TauCeti CI compiles untrusted PR Lean, which runs arbitrary code at build time (elaboration,
`initialize`, macros, a PR `lakefile`). `pull_request` runs the **PR's own** workflow file, so a
sandbox written into `ci.yml` would be defeatable (the PR strips it). The build therefore lives
in a **trusted, base-defined** `pull_request_target` workflow (`TauCeti/.github/workflows/pr-build.yml`):

- **Trusted definition + validated config.** The PR cannot change what runs. The build/audit use
  the base's `lakefile` and scripts, overlaying only validated sources plus forward-only manifest
  and toolchain pins. Any Lake configuration or other infrastructure path is routed to a human, so
  a PR cannot redefine what "build"/"axioms" mean to fake a green check.
- **Sandbox.** PR `TauCeti/` code compiles only under **landrun** (pinned `v0.1.14` + SHA256),
  offline (no network), writes confined to `base/.lake`, with `/dev` narrowed to specific nodes. A
  **fail-closed self-test** proves enforcement (out-of-tree write, `/dev/shm` write, and network
  all denied) before any PR code runs. Verified live: an adversarial build-time `#eval` had its
  out-of-tree write and network egress denied.
- **No secrets, no token in reach.** `permissions: contents:read, statuses:write`, no `secrets.*`,
  `persist-credentials:false`; the token is never in a landrun step's env. Mathlib is fetched via
  the trusted base checkout (no PR Lake on the network). The `build` commit status posted to the
  PR head SHA is the required merge check.
- **Fork auto-review.** `pull_request_target` runs automatically for fork PRs (no maintainer-
  approval gate), so fork PRs get sandboxed CI + downstream review without a human gate.

CI residuals (accepted): the `elan` installer is fetched live (trusted source, runs before PR
code, no secrets); review's PR resolution from `workflow_run` could pick the wrong PR if one head
SHA maps to multiple PRs (low); the fork auto-run path relies on documented `pull_request_target`
semantics (same-repo path verified live; a true fork build not yet exercised). The post-merge
`ci.yml` build on `main` is trusted (already-merged code).

## If a secret ever leaks

Public transcripts mean a leak is durable in git history. Response order: **revoke the key
first** (rotate the provider key / regenerate the App key), then scrub history if needed. The
mitigations above are designed so that there is no reachable secret to leak in the first place.
