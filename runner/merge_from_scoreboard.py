"""Compute the auto-merge decision from the PR's scoreboard COMMENTS (the live verdict source).

Any reviewer — the worker, or anyone running tauceti-review — posts a scoreboard comment on the PR
carrying a `<!--tauceti-meta:v1 {...}-->` block with `head_sha` and a full per-rubric `states` map. The
newest completed scoreboard at the current head is the verdict: a later completed review supersedes
an earlier one instead of making every disagreement a permanent veto. An unexpired
review-in-progress marker delays initial enqueue, but does not revoke an already-completed green
verdict; if that review later posts a blocking scoreboard, the completed verdict makes the review
state unsafe and the reconciler dequeues the PR. It is mergeable when that review state is safe, no
review is live, and the shared `decide_merge` rule also holds (build green, TauCeti/-only + allowed
root/pins, bump-guard for a pin). This is the "no bar" model: trust is the posted comment itself, so a
contributor with no repo write can still have their review count. The HARD boundary that a forged
scoreboard cannot bypass remains the CI build + scope + axiom audit + bump-guard checks.

For comments whose meta predates the `states` field, fall back to reading the rendered scoreboard
table (one row per rubric; the 3rd cell is the state word). Writes `merge.json` like before.
