"""Tau Ceti review runner.

Reviews a PR with agentic CLIs (claude / codex, random per rubric, read-only), posts an
aggregated verdict, and records spend. State lives in a `--store` directory (a checkout of
the `reviews` branch of TauCetiReview): `ledger.json` plus `reviews/<pr>/<round>/`. A daily
USD budget halts spending, and a `block` verdict halts the round early — the rubrics not yet
run stay deferred until the block clears. With `--auto-subset`, a re-review runs only the
rubrics whose last round was not `approve`. The workflow commits the store after the run.
