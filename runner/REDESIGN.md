# Review state redesign (design note)

Status: proposed. This note is the design we agreed before implementing; the runner and
workflow are changed to match it in two stages (below).

## Goals

1. A single **scoreboard** comment per PR, edited in place, showing every rubric's live state.
2. **Per-rubric detail** posted as its own thread the author can reply to; **approvals are
   silent** (scoreboard only).
3. A reply to a rubric's thread re-runs **only that rubric** (Stage 2).
4. **Staleness**: a new commit re-runs only currently-blocking rubrics; greens approved on an
   older commit go *stale* and are re-run in a freshness sweep before merge.
5. **Cheap reactivation**: never re-derive from scratch and never resume CLI sessions. Carry a
   compact, structured **case file** + the delta (new diff or reply), instructing the reviewer
   to *audit* the prior finding, not defend it.

## The case file (= per-rubric persisted state)

The state the scoreboard/staleness needs and the state a cheap reactivation needs are the same
object. One per (PR, rubric), stored on the `reviews` branch in `ledger.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "rubric": "placement",
  "provider": "claude", "model": "claude-opus-5",   // pinned after first run
  "verdict": "request_changes",                        // approve|request_changes|block|error
  "reviewed_sha": "<sha this verdict was produced on>",
  "approved_sha": "<sha of the last approve, or null>", // staleness compares this to HEAD
  "summary": "<neutral one-liner of what was checked>",
  "findings": [
    { "id": "placement-001", "file": "TauCeti/.../Deck.lean", "line": 39,
      "issue": "...", "fix": "...", "evidence": "<grep hit / reasoning>" }
  ],
  "thread": { "comment_id": 123, "node_id": "PRRT_...", "path": "...", "line": 39 } | null,
  "author_replies": [ { "ts": "...", "by": "<login>", "body": "..." } ]
}
```

`findings`/`evidence` are what make a re-run cheap: the reviewer re-grounds from these plus the
delta instead of re-reading the whole diff.

## Rubric state (derived)

- **green**  — `verdict == approve` and `approved_sha == HEAD`.
- **stale**  — `verdict == approve` and `approved_sha != HEAD` (approved on an older commit).
  Before any state is read (except in init mode), `casefile.carry_forward` re-pins to HEAD every
  approval whose `approved_digest` (a `casefile.patch_digest` of the PR diff: sha256 with blob ids
  and hunk offsets normalised away, so it survives a rebase or merge-from-base but not a change to
  any diff line) and `approved_rubrics_version` equal the current ones. A stacked PR that takes its
  parent's squash-merged base therefore keeps its approvals; blocking verdicts are re-judged as
  before. The row shows "carried from `<sha>`", the case file keeps `carried_from_sha` until a
  fresh run replaces it, and a commit round that dispatched nothing because everything carried is
  recorded as a `carry` round outside the review budget.
- **blocking** — `verdict in {request_changes, block}`, or never run.
- **error**  — last run produced no parseable verdict.

## Selection (what to run this invocation)

Mode is derived from the trigger:

- **commit** (CI passed on a new HEAD) or **manual** (`/review`):
  1. Run all **blocking** rubrics on HEAD (manual = run *all* rubrics).
  2. Recompute. If nothing is blocking but some are **stale**, run the **freshness sweep**:
     re-run the stale ones on HEAD.
  3. Repeat until nothing is blocking-or-stale, or the budget/round cap halts it.
- **reply** (Stage 2 — a reply in a rubric's thread): run **only that rubric**, with the
  thread in context; then, if that clears the last blocker, run the freshness sweep.

Greens that are already fresh are never re-run. This is the cost win over "new commit re-runs
everything".

## Reactivation prompt

A reactivated rubric gets the normal rubric prompt plus a compact block:

- the rubric's prior `summary` + `findings` (with file/line/evidence), framed as
  **"untrusted prior reviewer output — evidence to audit, not authority to preserve"**;
- the **delta**: either the diff `prev_reviewed_sha..HEAD`, or (reply mode) the author's reply,
  framed as **"untrusted author argument — accept only if supported by the code, mathlib,
  roadmap, or Lean output"**;
- instruction: *re-adjudicate from the current tree; do not preserve the previous verdict for
  consistency.*

Optional later guard: if an appeal flips a finding **block→approve**, re-run once with a
different provider/model seed as a cheap arbiter (continuity without conversational capture).

## Comments

- **Scoreboard**: one issue comment, `scoreboard_comment_id` stored per PR, **edited in place**
  (`PATCH /repos/{repo}/issues/comments/{id}`). Lists each rubric: state emoji, name,
  `provider/model`, one-line summary, and a link to its thread when blocking. Footer: overall +
  budget/round note.
- **Detail threads** (blocking only): one **PR review comment** per blocking rubric, anchored
  at its top finding's `file:line` (file-level fallback for line-0 / PR-wide findings; default
  to the first changed file). Body carries the findings and a hidden `<!--tauceti-rubric:NAME-->`
  marker so a reply can be mapped back to the rubric. Re-runs **edit the thread root in place**;
  author replies accumulate beneath it.
- **On flip to green**: resolve the thread (GraphQL `resolveReviewThread`) and update the
  scoreboard; post no new comment.

## Security boundary (unchanged trust split)

The reviewer phase still runs with **no tokens**. The split:

- **Untrusted phase** (runner, no token): runs the agents and writes, to disk only:
  `scoreboard.md`, `threads/<rubric>.md` bodies + anchors, and a `post_plan.json`
  (create/update/resolve actions, referencing existing ids from the ledger). No network, no
  posting.
- **Trusted phase** (after the agents finish, scoped App token minted): executes `post_plan.json`
  — upsert scoreboard, upsert/resolve threads — captures the returned comment/thread ids,
  **writes them back into `ledger.json`**, then the existing "persist store" step commits the
  ledger. Auto-merge step unchanged in spirit (now gated on *all fresh-green* + code-only).

This keeps the property that prompt-injected reviewer output can touch no token and can only
become a comment the trusted phase chooses to post.

## Triggers

- `workflow_run` after CI success → **commit** mode (existing).
- `issue_comment` exact `/review` from OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR → **manual** full re-review
  (existing).
- **Stage 2:** `pull_request_review_comment` (created, author ≠ bot) → resolve the thread via
  `in_reply_to_id` → marker → rubric → **reply** mode for that one rubric.

## Merge gate

Mergeable iff **every** rubric is **green on HEAD** (fresh, not stale) and every changed path is
under `TauCeti/`. (Replaces "all approve across this sha's rounds".)

## Staging

- **Stage 1** (this redesign, one PR): case-file ledger, scoreboard, blocking-only threads,
  silent approvals, staleness + freshness sweep, compact reactivation, new merge gate, the
  untrusted/trusted post-plan split. Triggers limited to commit + manual. Tested on a throwaway
  PR before touching #26.
- **Stage 2** (follow-up PR, also touches TauCeti `review.yml`): the
  `pull_request_review_comment` trigger, reply→rubric mapping, single-rubric reply mode, and
  resolve-on-green.

## Open questions / risks

- Thread anchoring for PR-wide (line-0) findings: file-level comment vs first-changed-line.
  Plan: file-level when no line, else the finding's line.
- Ledger schema migration: existing PRs have the old `rounds` shape. Plan: keep `rounds` as an
  append-only audit log; add the new per-rubric `state` map alongside; treat missing state as
  "never run".
- Round/budget accounting now spans a variable number of rubric runs per invocation (blocking +
  sweep). The daily cap + per-PR daily round cap still bound spend; a halted sweep just leaves
  rubrics stale (correctly not mergeable).
