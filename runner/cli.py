"""`tauceti-review` — run the Tau Ceti AI review on a PR with your own subscription.

This is the user-facing front end to the same review engine CI runs (`runner/review.py` +
`runner/post.py`). Where CI bills the Anthropic / OpenAI APIs, this drives the locally
logged-in `claude` and `codex` CLIs, so the inference runs on *your* subscription at no
metered cost. You stay the trusted party: it reviews read-only, posts under your own GitHub
identity, and defaults to a dry run that prints the verdicts without touching the PR.

    tauceti-review 42                 # review PR #42, print the verdicts (no posting)
    tauceti-review 42 --post          # also post the scoreboard + threads as you
    tauceti-review 42 --rubrics scope,correctness,reuse --no-mathlib

It assembles the same reviewer workspace CI does — the PR source at its head, the roadmap, and
(unless --no-mathlib) the pinned Mathlib source for grep — then invokes the engine in
`--auth subscription` mode. The rubrics and engine come from a checkout of THIS repo
(TauCetiReview): the one you ran from if it is a checkout, else a cached shallow clone, so the
rubrics always match the engine.

Prerequisites on PATH and logged in: `git`, `gh` (`gh auth login`), `claude` (Claude
subscription) and/or `codex` (ChatGPT subscription). Each rubric is judged by whichever of the
two you have available.
