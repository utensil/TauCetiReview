"""Merge sweep: re-drive green PRs the merge queue evicted, so an eviction is never terminal.

auto-merge.yml enqueues a green PR exactly once per triggering event (a push, a `/review` comment, or a
fresh pr-build on that PR). GitHub's merge queue then retests the PR against the CURRENT main and, if
that rebuild fails or the merge group cannot form, EVICTS it (`removed_from_merge_queue`). Nothing then
re-drives an otherwise-idle green PR: no new push/comment/build fires, so it sits enqueued-once,
evicted-once, and stranded — green on every rubric yet never merged. housekeeping.py only CLOSES PRs
(and only blocking ones), so a wedged-but-green PR is closed by nothing; without this sweep it would
strand forever. This runs on a schedule and re-drives them:

  enqueue        The default. For a green-at-head, TauCeti/-only, mergeable PR that targets main and is
                 not already in the queue, re-enqueue it. Cheap: it reuses the EXISTING head-pinned green
                 review (no re-review, no API spend), and the queue's own rebuild-against-main is the
                 real test. This rescues the common case — a transient eviction (a merge group that could
                 not form, or a PR that has fallen behind a moving main but still builds on it).

  update-branch  The escalation. If the queue has already evicted THIS head >= EVICT_ESCALATE times
                 (counted from the PR's removed_from_merge_queue timeline events after the head became
                 current), the queue has proven this commit cannot merge onto main — re-enqueuing only
                 burns another merge_group build. Instead, update the branch onto main: that re-runs the
                 build + review against current main, turning a wedged-green PR into a normal one. Only
                 when the PR is behind main (there is something to update); update-branch merges base into
                 head (the queue squash-merges, so the extra merge commit never reaches main).

  flag           If update-branch conflicts (e.g. two PRs added the same declaration), the PR needs
                 human/worker reconciliation, not a retry: label it `needs-rebase`, comment once, and
                 stop. Also used if a PR is evicted past the threshold yet is NOT behind main.

A `keep` label (also hold/wip/human/do-not-close) opts a PR out. Drafts, non-main bases, and PRs
touching paths outside the merge policy are skipped. Every mutation is gated on DRY_RUN
and bound to the reviewed head, and a real execution failure exits nonzero; benign races (already
queued, head moved) do not. The merge decision is the SAME decide_from_comments the merge-only path
uses, so the sweep can never enqueue something the normal gate would refuse.
