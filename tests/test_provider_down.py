"""A provider outage ends the round; it does not become a review.

On 2026-08-13 an OAuth token was revoked mid-round. `correctness` had already approved; `reuse`
failed; then eight more rubrics failed five seconds apart, each recording the CLI's own
"Failed to authenticate. API Error: 401 OAuth access token has been revoked." as its result. The
round rendered a scoreboard headed "changes requested" with nine `⚠️ error` rows and POSTED it, and
an errored rubric blocks the merge. Across the stores this had happened 639 times, 107 of them
whole rounds, and the commonest text was not a status code at all but
"You've hit your session limit · resets 9:30pm (UTC)".

Two things were missing and are pinned here:

  1. error_kind only read stderr. Claude Code in -p mode puts a total provider failure in the
     RESULT text with an empty stderr, so every one of those classified as `unknown_error`. It now
     reads that text too — but only once the CLI itself reports the run as failed, because `text` is
     model output over an untrusted diff and a short review saying "the `/login` handler returns
     401" must never read as an auth outage.
  2. Nothing stopped the round. Two consecutive provider-down ATTEMPTS on every configured provider
     now abort it before anything is rendered or posted, with a distinct exit status the CLI reports
     as itself. Attempts rather than rubrics, so a one-rubric reply round can stop too; every
     provider rather than any, so one provider's quota running out is not an outage while another
     can still review.

Exit 0 = all assertions hold; 1 = a mismatch.
