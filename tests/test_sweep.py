"""The merge sweep's decision must re-drive evicted-but-green PRs without thrashing on broken ones.

Covers decide_action (the pure policy) and that the merge gate it relies on (decide_from_comments) is
the SAME one the merge-only path uses, so the sweep can never enqueue something the normal gate refuses.
Dependency-free — run with `python tests/test_sweep.py` or under pytest.
