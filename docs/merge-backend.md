# Merge backend admission

The reusable merge workflows read TauCetiProject/TauCeti's `MERGE_BACKEND` live with the Review App. An unset variable defaults to GitHub queue only after a successful authenticated variables listing. The older merge_backend workflow input remains accepted for callers but does not choose admission.

Both App registration and installation require Variables read. The pinned create-github-app-token action discovers permission inputs from environment keys, so the merge jobs set `INPUT_PERMISSION-ACTIONS-VARIABLES: read` in addition to their existing scoped write permissions.

`runner/backend.py` is shared by event reconciliation and sweep. New GitHub enqueues require queue selected and all main bors batches drained. New bors approvals require bors selected and GitHub main queue empty. The receiver guards delayed commands independently. Observation errors defer admissions; unsafe reviews still attempt revocation in both queues. Existing native reservations and eviction recovery remain native-only. A sweep under bors invokes the same exact-head CI/scope/review policy, with immutable bors membership and terminal outcomes for deduplication.

The public bors observation endpoint must be deployed before repinning TauCeti. It preserves existing batch_ids and adds the tauceti-bors.observation/v1 contract. Unknown/legacy heads cannot prove a fresh approval. An old r+ comment cannot prove admission; a deferred/lost command can be retried. Terminal failure at the same head requires an explicit bors retry or a new head. A live review marker does not revoke a prior green standing approval.

The trusted sweep accepts repository_dispatch tauceti-merge-reconcile in TauCeti. It runs no reviewer and stages no provider keys. Heartbeat labels merely request reconciliation and never authorize merging. The bors deployment runbook documents rollout, manual switches, and experiment measurements.

## Sweep API use

Heartbeat and normal manual wakeups run a focused sweep: existing GitHub queue entries, active or held bors approvals, and ready-to-merge/needs-rebase labels. Active approvals take priority, including draft/held PRs that need unsafe-review withdrawal. Labels only select work; every admission retains the exact-head CI, review, scope, merge-base and live-backend checks. Unknown queue membership expands withdrawal checks instead of treating the queue as empty.

Hourly sweeps and manual runs with `full-scan=true` also inspect unlabelled PRs. Background and priority ordering changes over time so bounded work does not always skip the same PRs. The runner reads installation quota once, preserves 1,000 REST requests and 100 GraphQL points for concurrent event-driven jobs, and limits itself to 120 gh invocations per focused sweep or 800 per comprehensive sweep. It starts a new PR only with a 30-invocation working allowance, allowing an in-flight PR's integrity checks to finish. Invocation counts are not HTTP page counts or GraphQL points; these are best-effort bounds under concurrent usage. A rate-limit response stops scanning the remaining PRs into repeated 403s; an unsafe withdrawal still attempts both queues once. Budget deferrals are logged and retried by later wakeups. Unreadable quota, actual rate limits, and earlier action failures keep a failing run result; observation errors never permit an admission.
